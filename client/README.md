## Description
This folder contains client-side code that will be run in the user's browser.

The `src` folder is for development and does not need to be provided to the server.
The `build` folder contains the compiled angular code (bundle.js) which will be served alongside html content.

NOTE: When making edits please make them to the `src` folder. `grunt` will copy and compile the contents of the `src` folder into the `build` folder automatically.
